## Non-null Assertion Operator (!)
TypeScript also has a special syntax for removing null and undefined from a type without doing any explicit checking. Writing ! after any expression is effectively a type assertion that the value isn’t null or undefined:
```ts
function liveDangerously(x?: number | null) {
  // No error
  console.log(x!.toFixed());
}
```
Just like other type assertions, this doesn’t change the runtime behavior of your code, so it’s important to only use ! when you know that the value can’t be null or undefined.
