Itâ€™s not much use to have a variable that can only have one value!

But by combining literals into unions, you can express a much more useful concept - for example, functions that only accept a certain set of known values:
```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
function printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center") {
  // ...
}
printText("Hello, world", "left");
printText("G'day, mate", "centre");
```
Numeric literal types work the same way:
```ts
function compare(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1 {
  return a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1;
}
```
