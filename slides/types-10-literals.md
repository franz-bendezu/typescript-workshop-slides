In addition to the general types string and number, we can refer to specific strings and numbers in type positions.

One way to think about this is to consider how JavaScript comes with different ways to declare a variable. Both var and let allow for changing what is held inside the variable, and const does not. This is reflected in how TypeScript creates types for literals.

let changingString = "Hello World";
changingString = "Olá Mundo";
// Because `changingString` can represent any possible string, that
// is how TypeScript describes it in the type system
changingString;
      
let changingString: string
 
const constantString = "Hello World";
// Because `constantString` can only represent 1 possible string, it
// has a literal type representation
constantString;
      
const constantString: "Hello World"
Try
By themselves, literal types aren’t very valuable:

let x: "hello" = "hello";
// OK
x = "hello";
// ...
x = "howdy";
Type '"howdy"' is not assignable to type '"hello"'.
Try
It’s not much use to have a variable that can only have one value!

But by combining literals into unions, you can express a much more useful concept - for example, functions that only accept a certain set of known values:

function printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center") {
  // ...
}
printText("Hello, world", "left");
printText("G'day, mate", "centre");
Argument of type '"centre"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right" | "center"'.
Try
Numeric literal types work the same way:

function compare(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1 {
  return a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1;
}
Try
Of course, you can combine these with non-literal types:

interface Options {
  width: number;
}
function configure(x: Options | "auto") {
  // ...
}
configure({ width: 100 });
configure("auto");
configure("automatic");
Argument of type '"automatic"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Options | "auto"'.
Try
There’s one more kind of literal type: boolean literals. There are only two boolean literal types, and as you might guess, they are the types true and false. The type boolean itself is actually just an alias for the union true | false.

Literal Inference
When you initialize a variable with an object, TypeScript assumes that the properties of that object might change values later. For example, if you wrote code like this:

const obj = { counter: 0 };
if (someCondition) {
  obj.counter = 1;
}
Try
TypeScript doesn’t assume the assignment of 1 to a field which previously had 0 is an error. Another way of saying this is that obj.counter must have the type number, not 0, because types are used to determine both reading and writing behavior.

The same applies to strings:

const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" };
handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"GET" | "POST"'.
Try
In the above example req.method is inferred to be string, not "GET". Because code can be evaluated between the creation of req and the call of handleRequest which could assign a new string like "GUESS" to req.method, TypeScript considers this code to have an error.

There are two ways to work around this.

You can change the inference by adding a type assertion in either location:

// Change 1:
const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" as "GET" };
// Change 2
handleRequest(req.url, req.method as "GET");
Try
Change 1 means “I intend for req.method to always have the literal type "GET"”, preventing the possible assignment of "GUESS" to that field after. Change 2 means “I know for other reasons that req.method has the value "GET"“.

You can use as const to convert the entire object to be type literals:

const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" } as const;
handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
